# Running the TypeScript File with ts-node

This project includes a TypeScript script `Find_Duplicate_Strings.ts` that finds duplicate strings, words, and characters. Below are the steps to run this file using `ts-node`.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js** (Download from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/))
2. **TypeScript** (Install globally if not already installed)
3. **ts-node** (Used to execute TypeScript files without compiling them first)

## Installation

### 1. Install TypeScript and ts-node (if not already installed)
Run the following command to install them globally:

```sh
npm install -g typescript ts-node
```

Alternatively, install them locally in the project:

```sh
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-node
```

### 2. Verify Installation
Check if `ts-node` is installed by running:

```sh
ts-node -v
```

## Running the Script

### 1. Navigate to the Project Directory
Open a terminal or PowerShell and navigate to the folder containing the script:

```sh
cd E:\project1\100daysofCode\Day_2
```

### 2. Run the TypeScript File
Use the following command to execute the script using `ts-node`:

```sh
npx ts-node Find_Duplicate_Strings.ts
```

Or, if you have installed `ts-node` globally:

```sh
ts-node Find_Duplicate_Strings.ts
```

If you encounter errors related to module resolution, try running:

```sh
npx ts-node ./Find_Duplicate_Strings.ts
```

## Expected Output
Upon successful execution, the script will display duplicate strings, words, and characters from the given input, similar to:

```sh
Duplicate Strings: Map(3) { 'apple' => 2, 'banana' => 2, 'orange' => 2 }
Duplicate Words: Map(4) { 'this' => 2, 'is' => 2, 'a' => 2, 'test' => 2 }
Duplicate Characters: Map(3) { 'r' => 2, 'g' => 2, 'm' => 2 }
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you see `ts-node: command not found`, ensure `ts-node` is installed globally or use `npx ts-node`.
- If you get a `Cannot find module` error, check if the file name is correct and exists in the specified directory.
- If necessary, reinstall dependencies using:
  
  ```sh
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
  npm install
  ```

## Conclusion
This guide helps you execute TypeScript scripts using `ts-node` efficiently. Feel free to modify the script to test different input cases!



Happy coding! ðŸš€
